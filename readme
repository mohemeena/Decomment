Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

I used AI in the following ways: helping me edit comments in the code 
and write out my comments for each of my functions.
I also used it for help with git commands and pushing/pulling from git
as well as debugging syntax errors in my code including how I wrote
"/" and "'" in my code.

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?
I think this was a very helpful assignment as it helped me understand
how to work through code in C and learn the syntax. I also learned
a lot about state machines and how they work and applying a DFA. I also learned a lot
about git and how to use it effectively, as well as helpful shortcuts. I also think it was fun
to work on a project that has a real world application.
